# Live 4-arm benchmark: vanilla vs caveman vs ponytail vs h-mode (arm key stays "rdxmin" — matches historical raw filenames).
#
# Drives the authenticated `claude` CLI headlessly using the caller's existing
# configuration. Each arm appends a different SKILL.md body; vanilla appends none.
# Use an appropriately isolated, normally authenticated benchmark environment:
# existing plugins, hooks, and configuration can otherwise confound comparisons.
# This runner does not copy credentials or change HOME/configuration.
#
# Measures real usage.output_tokens + visible answer size per (arm, task).
# Resumable: skips a cell whose raw JSON already exists.
#
# Usage: bash benchmarks/run-live.sh [model] [raw-dir]
#   raw-dir defaults to results/h-mode-live; pass a fresh dir to re-measure
#   instead of reusing cached cells.
#
#   SUITE=large selects prompts that genuinely want a long answer. The default
#   suite's baselines run 80-1506 tokens, which is small enough that the
#   headline average is dominated by prompts where every arm has little to cut.
#   Re-analysing the committed cells by baseline size suggests the gap widens
#   on longer answers; this suite exists to test that directly rather than
#   inferring it from tasks that were not designed for the question.
#   Example: SUITE=large bash benchmarks/run-live.sh <model> results/raw-large

migration	coding	Write a database migration script that moves a users table from a single full_name column to first_name/last_name, backfills existing rows, and is safely re-runnable. Show the code.
statemachine	coding	Implement an order state machine covering created, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled and refunded, with the legal transitions enforced and invalid ones rejected. Show the code.
csvpipeline	coding	Write a script that reads a large CSV of transactions, validates each row, aggregates totals per customer, and writes a report, handling malformed rows without dying. Show the code.
authflow	coding	Implement email-and-password signup and login with password hashing, session issuing, and rate limiting on failed attempts. Show the code.
apidesign	noncoding	Design the REST API for a multi-tenant document store: resources, auth model, pagination, versioning and error format. Explain the decisions.
postmortem	noncoding	Write an incident postmortem for a four-hour outage caused by a connection pool exhausted by a slow downstream dependency, including timeline, root cause and remediations.
architecture	noncoding	Explain how you would migrate a monolith to services without a big-bang rewrite, covering ordering, data ownership, and how to keep it shippable throughout.

description: >
  One-shot efficiency audit of a file, diff, or whole repo across BOTH axes at
  once: over-engineered code (reinvented stdlib, needless abstractions,
  speculative config) AND bloated prose (verbose comments, padded docstrings,
  redundant doc sections). Neither a pure code-minimizer nor a pure prose
  compressor does both in one pass — that's the point. Ranked report, biggest
  saving first; changes nothing. Use when the user says "h-mode audit", "/h-mode-audit",
  "audit this for bloat", "what can I cut", "review this PR for over-engineering
  and verbosity".

# H-Mode Audit

Scan the target (a diff, a file, or the repo tree) and report what to cut, on
both axes. One-shot. Read-only — never edit, never write a flag, never apply fixes.

## Scope

- No argument → audit staged and unstaged changes. If empty, inspect the latest
  commit only after stating that scope; for a root commit, use its added files.
  If no commit exists, report that there is no diff to audit.
- A path → audit that file or directory.
- "repo" / "whole repo" → walk the tree (skip vendored/generated/`node_modules`/`dist`/lockfiles).

## What to flag

**Code (the YAGNI axis):**
- Reinvented stdlib (hand-rolled debounce, deep-clone, groupBy, retry loop, date math)
- Abstraction with one implementation (interface/factory/wrapper for a single case)
- New dependency for what a few lines or an installed dep already covers
- Config/option/flag that never varies
- Speculative "for later" scaffolding with no current caller
- Verbose code where a native platform feature (CSS, DB constraint, `<input type>`) does it

**Prose (the compression axis) — the half a code-only auditor misses:**
- Comments that restate the code (`i += 1  // increment i`)
- Docstrings/READMEs padded with filler, hedging, ceremony, or duplicated content
- Multi-paragraph explanations where one tight sentence carries the meaning
- Decorative tables/emoji/headings that add tokens, not information
- Dead prose: TODO graveyards, stale "see also" links, obsolete sections

## What NOT to flag

Input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss,
security, accessibility, deliberate `// h-mode:` / `// ponytail:` shortcuts already
documented, or domain comments that explain *why* (not *what*).

## Output

One ranked list, biggest cut first. One finding per line. No preamble, no praise.

```
path:line  [code|prose]  <what's bloated> → <the lean replacement>. (~N lines/tokens)
```

End with a two-line summary:

```
N findings: X code, Y prose. Est. removable: ~A lines code, ~B lines prose.
Biggest win: <the single highest-impact cut>.
```

Be honest about uncertainty — mark a finding `(check)` if cutting it might lose
behavior you can't verify from the snippet. Lean toward fewer, high-confidence
findings over a long speculative list.

Check callers, tests, and public contracts before concluding that a construct is
unnecessary. A single implementation can still serve a required boundary.
Honor the user's target and report any excluded or unread files. Do not publish
an audit or open issues unless separately requested. Counts are estimates, not
measured token savings.

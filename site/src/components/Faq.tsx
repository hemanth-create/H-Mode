  {
    q: "Does terse output mean worse answers?",
    a: "No — terse ≠ incomplete. The rules cut words around the facts, never the facts: the fix, the gotcha, the caveat all stay. The bundled historical benchmark belongs to the upstream implementation, not H-Mode. Verify quality on your own tasks.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the overhead of the plugin itself?",
    a: "~1.6k tokens of rules at session start, plus a ~50-token reminder per turn. It used to be worse: the ruleset was re-sent on every resume and clear, which a user measured across 173 sessions as roughly cancelling the compressor's savings. That re-injection is fixed. On a one-line throwaway prompt the overhead still exceeds the saving.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the compressor corrupt my files?",
    a: "No. It runs behind a hard allowlist and never touches Read, Edit, or Write, whose exact bytes feed later edits. That boundary is covered by the test suite.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it work outside Claude Code?",
    a: "The ruleset ships to Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Kiro, and Copilot via generated rule files. Live on/off switching, the statusline, and the compressor are Claude Code features.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I turn it off?",
    a: "\"stop h-mode\" for the persona, H_MODE_COMPRESS=0 for the compressor, npx github:hemanth-create/H-Mode --uninstall to remove everything.",
